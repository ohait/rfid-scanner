# rfid-scanner
RFID scanner for libraries

This project contains arduino code, schematics, 3d models and server implementation for a generic library rfid scanner.

It is currently a prototype for [http://www.deichman.no] and therefor only specific hardware is supported, but the plan is to make it as generic as possible
